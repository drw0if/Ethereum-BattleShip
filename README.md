# BattleShip on Ethereum Blockchain

This is my implementation of the BattleShip game on the Etehereum blockchain, developed for the "Peer to peer and blockchain" exam @ UniPi.

In order to run the frontend please run:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build 
```
from the root directory.
The command will spawn a webserver on port 8000, so go [here](http://localhost:8000)

In order to deploy the contract and to understand how it works please refer to the documentation [here](frontend/static/Documentation.pdf), that can also viewed, more comfortably from the frontend itself [here](http://localhost:8000/Documentation.pdf)
